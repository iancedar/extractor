File Structure:
- index.html (frontend interface)
- style.css (responsive styling)
- script.js (frontend logic)
- server.js (Express server with API endpoints)
- gemini-client.js (Gemini API wrapper)
- content-processor.js (content cleaning and validation)
- package.json (dependencies and scripts)

API ENDPOINTS:
- POST /extract-keywords (main extraction endpoint)
- POST /fetch-content (content fetching with validation)
- GET /health (API health check)

ERROR HANDLING:
- Invalid URL format validation
- Failed content fetching (404, timeout, etc.)
- Gemini API errors (invalid key, rate limits, quota exceeded)
- Empty or insufficient content
- JSON parsing errors from API response
- Fallback extraction if API fails

SECURITY FEATURES:
- API key validation and secure handling
- Input sanitization and URL validation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Content length limits for API calls
- CORS configuration for security
- Environment variable protection

DEBUGGING FEATURES:
- Content preview panel (first 1000 characters of fetched content)
- API call statistics and response times
- Extraction method indicator (AI vs fallback)
- Console logging for development
- Error tracking and reporting

VALIDATION SYSTEM:
- Verify all extracted keywords exist in original content
- Content source validation for each keyword
- Minimum content length requirements
- API response validation and error handling
- Keyword relevance scoring

FALLBACK SYSTEM:
If Gemini API fails, implement basic keyword extraction using:
- Frequency analysis for important terms
- Named entity recognition for companies/people/places
- Pattern matching for financial terms and dates
- Sentence extraction for key announcements

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
Create these environment variables in Replit Secrets:
- GEMINI_API_KEY (from Google AI Studio)
- PORT (default: 3000)

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Intuitive single-page interface
- Clear progress indicators
- Helpful error messages with solutions
- Fast response times with caching
- Professional, modern design
- Accessible for all devices

The final tool should be production-ready, handle all edge cases gracefully, extract only real content from press releases, and generate highly searchable keywords that help users find exact press releases in LLM conversations.
